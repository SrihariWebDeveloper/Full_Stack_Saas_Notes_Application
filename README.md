# üìù Multi-Tenant SaaS Notes Application

## üöÄ Objective
This project is a multi-tenant SaaS Notes Application deployed on **Vercel**, designed to allow multiple companies (tenants) to securely manage their users and notes. It enforces strict data isolation, role-based access control, and subscription-based feature gating.

---

## üß© Features

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
- Supports two tenants: **Acme** and **Globex**
- Ensures complete data isolation between tenants
- **Chosen Approach**: _Shared schema with a `tenantId` column_  
  This approach simplifies deployment while maintaining strict access boundaries via scoped queries and middleware enforcement.

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based login system
- Two roles:
  - **Admin**: Can invite users and upgrade subscriptions
  - **Member**: Can create, view, edit, and delete notes
- Predefined test accounts (password: `password`):
  | Email               | Role   | Tenant  |
  |--------------------|--------|---------|
  | admin@acme.test     | Admin  | Acme    |
  | user@acme.test      | Member | Acme    |
  | admin@globex.test   | Admin  | Globex  |
  | user@globex.test    | Member | Globex  |

### 3. Subscription Feature Gating
- **Free Plan**: Max 3 notes per tenant
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited notes
- Upgrade endpoint:  
  `POST /tenants/:slug/upgrade` (Admin only)  
  ‚Üí Instantly lifts note limit upon upgrade

### 4. Notes API (CRUD)
All endpoints enforce tenant isolation and role-based access:
- `POST /notes` ‚Äì Create a note
- `GET /notes` ‚Äì List all notes for current tenant
- `GET /notes/:id` ‚Äì Retrieve a specific note
- `PUT /notes/:id` ‚Äì Update a note
- `DELETE /notes/:id` ‚Äì Delete a note

### 5. Deployment
- Hosted on **Vercel** (frontend and backend)
- CORS enabled for external access
- Health check endpoint:  
  `GET /health` ‚Üí `{ "status": "ok" }`

### 6. Frontend
- Minimal UI hosted on Vercel
- Supports:
  - Login with test accounts
  - Listing, creating, and deleting notes
  - ‚ÄúUpgrade to Pro‚Äù prompt when Free plan limit is reached

- Health endpoint availability
- Login functionality for all test accounts
- Tenant data isolation
- Role-based access enforcement
- Subscription limit enforcement and upgrade behavior
- CRUD operations
- Frontend accessibility and functionality
